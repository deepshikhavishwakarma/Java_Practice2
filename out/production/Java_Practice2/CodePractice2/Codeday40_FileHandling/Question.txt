print the data in the console as well as write the data to another file called JavaStudent.txt.
 Example :
Test Case - 1 :
-----------------
Sample Input:
Attempt to read data from a non-existent file NonExistentFile.txt.

JavaStudent.txt contains: ``
 Program 02 :
------------
Create two files abc.txt and xyz.txt by using FileOutputStream class
Task is to read the data from both the files by using SequenceInputStream class.
 Test Case-1:

Valid Data in Both Files
 Sample Input:
 Create abc.txt with the content "Hello, ".
Create xyz.txt with the content "World!".
Read from both files using SequenceInputStream.
 Expected Output:
