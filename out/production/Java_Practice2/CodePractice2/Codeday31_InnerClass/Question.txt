Verify .class names for programs
1 point
Q1. Predict the number of classes and class names generated by compiler for the following code?

class Example{

static class A{}

class B{}

void m1(){

class C{}



}

}




Q2. Predict the .class file names for below code:

class Example{

static class A();

class B{};

void m1(){

class C{};

new Thread(){};

class D{}

}

void m2(){

class C{};

class E{}

new Thread(){};

}

}

Accessing Inner Class Members from Outer Class
Problem: Write a Java program where:

The outer class Outer contains an inner class Inner.
The inner class has a method displayMessage() that prints a message.
Create an instance of the inner class inside the outer class and invoke the displayMessage() method from the outer class.
Requirements:

The inner class should be a non-static inner class.
You should instantiate the inner class within a method of the outer class and invoke the inner class method from the outer class.

Q-4)
------
Find out the error in the code and rectify the errors and write the

code in your notebook with observation:

class Example{

int x=10;

static class A{

static void m1(){

A a1 = new A();

System.out.println(a1.x);



Example e1 = new Example();

System.out.println(e1.x);

}}}

WAP for the given requirements

WAP for the following requirement:

1. Create an outer class

2. Create a static inner class

3. SIC contains private non static data member,

static method, and

non static method.

4. Outer class has main method

5. Access all the data members and methods of SIC from

main method in outer class.

Write the compilation and execution commands to execute the inner class and outer class separately.
Note down steps in notebook along with program and output.
