Que-1)
________________________
Given an array of integers, return true if the array length is 1 or more,and the first element and the
last elements both are equal.    (task1)

Que-2)
---------------
Given 2 arrays of integers, a and b, return true if they have the same first element or they have the   (task2)
same last element. Both arrays will be length 1 or more.

Que-3)
---------------
Given an array of integers length 3, return an array with the elements    (task3)
"rotated left" so {1, 2, 3} will become  {2, 3, 1}.

Que-4)
----------------
Given an array of integers length 3, figure out which is larger element in that array and
return the largest element with the help of the method ?        (task 4)

Que-5)
----------------
Given an array of integers length 3, figure out which is larger, the first or last element in the array,
and set all the other elements to be that value. Return the changed array.      (task 5)

Que-6)
----------------
Given an array of integers, return true if 15 appears as either the first or last element in the array.
       The array will be length 1 or more.  (task6)

Que-7)
----------------
Given an array of integers length 3, return a new array with the elements in reverse order,
so {1, 2, 3} becomes {3, 2, 1}.     (task 7)

Que-8)
----------------
Given an array of integers, return the sum of the first 2 elements in the array.
If the array length is less than 2, just sum up the elements that exist,
return 0 if the array is having length 0.   (task 8)

Que-9)
________________________
Given 2 integer arrays, a and b, each length is 3, return a new array length 2
containing their middle elements.  (task 9)

Que-10)
_________________
Given an array of integers, return a new array length 2 containing the first and
last elements from the original array. The original array will be length 1 or more

Que-11)
_________________
Given an integer array length 2,return true if it contains a number 2 or 3.
(task 11)

Ques -12)
------------------
Given an integer array nums,return an array answer such that
answer[i] is equal to the product of all elements of nums except
 nums[i]


Ques - 13)
------------------
Given an integer array nums, move all the 0's to the end of
it while maintaining the relative order of the non - zero elements.
Note that you must do this in place without making a copy of array.

Ques- 14
------------------

Ques- 15
------------------

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day
 in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.



Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
