 Create the java program by creating the method as Boolean type which will return the
 array element is a neon number of not and print which number is neon and which number is not a neon ?

For example:-
Case 1:
----------------------
Input  : 9
Output : Given number  9 is Neon number

Explanation : square of 9=9*9=81;
              sum of digit of square : 8+1=9(which is equal to given number)


Case 2:
----------------------
Input : 8
Output : Given number is not a Neon number

Explanation : square of 8=8*8=64
              sum of digit of square : 6+4=10(which is not equal to given number)


take the array with the some element like
int [] arr= {1,2,3,8,9,11,6}
Output : you have to print amoung them which are neon number and which are not

Solution  ->  NeonArray.java

 Create the java program by creating the method as Boolean type which will return the
 array element is a smith number of not and print which number is smith and which number is not a smith ?

For example:-
A Smith number is a composite number whose sum of digits equals to the sum of
digits of its prime factors, excluding 1. It is also known as a joke number

Input as: 85

Sum of digits = 8 + 5 = 13

Prime factors of 85 is: 5,17

Sum of digits of its prime factors = 5 + 1+ 7 = 13

Compare the sum of digits with the sum of digits of its prime factors i.e. 13=13. Both are equal. Hence, the given number (85) is a smith number.


take the array with the some element like
int [] arr= {1,55,85,999}
Output : you have to print amoung them which are smith number and which are not



Solution  ->  AmithArray.java

[ Note: Must complete these 2 task, you guys can take the hint from the notes  of armstrong program
             Follow the same pattern how we had done in the class by writting method and how to call the methods ]
