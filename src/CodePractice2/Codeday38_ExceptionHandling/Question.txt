Question-1
---------------
Implement a Java program that simulates various car-related exceptions using custom exception classes (CarStopped, CarPuncture, CarHeat). The program should handle different scenarios and test cases using the CarTest class and demonstrate exception handling through static methods.

For CarStoppedException: extends Exception
Purpose: Represents an exception when the car stops for reasons other than puncture or overheating.

Instance Methods:
No Instance methods

Methods:
Parameterized Constructor with String as parameter

For CarPunctureException: extends Exception
This class is used for raise the exception if car is punctured.
Instance Methods:
No Instance methods

Methods:
Parameterized Constructor with String as parameter

For CarHeatException: extends Exception
This class is used for raise the exception if the car engine is more than 50 degrees Celsius

Instance Methods:
No Instance methods

Methods:
Parameterized Constructor with String as parameter

For CarTest class:
Contains static methods to simulate car operations and throw exceptions based on certain conditions.

Instance Variables:
No Instance Variables

Methods:
Stop(String): void: static

This class throws CarStoppedException. If the string is  stop  throw new exception and get the message or else message is Car not stall


Methods:
puncture(String): void: static: public

This class throws CarPunctureException. If the string is  puncture  throw new exception and get the message line  Car is punctured  or else message is Car not stall.

Methods:
carHeat(int): void: static : public

This class throws CarHeatException. If the car heat is more than 50 degrees calicoes it throw new exception and get the message line  Car is heated more the 50 degrees  or else message is Car not stall.

ELC class CarUser :-
Invoke stop, puncture, and carHeat methods with appropriate messages or temperatures to test different scenarios.
Ensure that exceptions are properly thrown and caught where applicable.

Test Cases for Car Exceptions
----------------------------------
Car Stopped Exception Test:
Action: Invoke CarTest.stop("stop").
Expected Output: Should throw CarStoppedException with message "Car stopped for some reason."

Car Not Stalled Test:
Action: Invoke CarTest.stop("go").
Expected Output: Should print "Car not stalled."

Car Puncture Exception Test:
Action: Invoke CarTest.puncture("puncture").
Expected Output: Should throw CarPunctureException with message "Car is punctured."

Car Not Punctured Test:
Action: Invoke CarTest.puncture("move").
Expected Output: Should print "Car not punctured."

Car Overheating Exception Test:
Action: Invoke CarTest.carHeat(60).
Expected Output: Should throw CarHeatException with message "Car is heated more than 50 degrees Celsius."

Car Temperature Normal Test:
Action: Invoke CarTest.carHeat(40).
Expected Output: Should print "Car temperature normal."

Bank Application
Objective:
Develop a Java program for a bank application that performs deposit, withdrawal, transfer, loan application, and balance check operations with proper input validation and error handling. The program should utilize a Bank interface, BankAccount and Customer classes, and an ATM class to demonstrate the application's functionality. Use custom exceptions, switch-case statements, try-with-resources, and multi-catch blocks for error handling.

Requirements:
Custom Exceptions:

class InsufficientFundsException(Checked):
Methods:
Parameterized Constructor with String as parameter
Purpose: Thrown when there are not enough funds for a withdrawal or transfer.

class InvalidAmountException(Unchecked):
Methods:
Parameterized Constructor with String as parameter
Purpose: Thrown when an invalid amount is entered for any transaction.

class AccountNotFoundException(Checked):
Methods:
Parameterized Constructor with String as parameter
Purpose: Thrown when an account is not found during a transfer.

class LoanNotAllowedException(Unchecked):
Methods:
Parameterized Constructor with String as parameter
Purpose:
Thrown when the loan amount exceeds the allowed limit.

Bank Interface:
-------------------
Methods:

Method name: deposit
return type : void
parameters : double amount
throws InvalidAmountException
Deposits the specified amount into the account. Throws InvalidAmountException if the amount is less than or equal to zero.


Method name: withdraw
return type : void
parameters : double amount
throws InsufficientFundsException, InvalidAmountException:
Withdraws the specified amount from the account. Throws InsufficientFundsException if the amount is greater than the account balance. Throws InvalidAmountException if the amount is less than or equal to zero.


Method name: transfer
return type : void
parameters : (BankAccount toAccount, double amount)
throws InsufficientFundsException, AccountNotFoundException, InvalidAmountException:
Transfers the specified amount to another account. Throws InsufficientFundsException if the amount is greater than the account balance. Throws AccountNotFoundException if the target account is not found. Throws InvalidAmountException if the amount is less than or equal to zero.


Method name: applyForLoan
return type : void
parameters : (double amount)
throws LoanNotAllowedException, InvalidAmountException:
Applies for a loan of the specified amount(50000). Throws LoanNotAllowedException if the loan amount exceeds the allowed limit(50000) or if the balance is less than specified amount(50000). Throws InvalidAmountException if the amount is less than or equal to zero.

Method name: getBalance
return type : double
Returns the current balance of the account.

BankAccount Class(BLC):
Attributes:
accountNumber: long: private
balance:double: private

Implements Bank interface.
Methods:
Implement all methods from the Bank interface.
deposit(double amount): Increases the account balance by the specified amount. Throws InvalidAmountException if the amount is less than or equal to zero.

withdraw(double amount): Decreases the account balance by the specified amount. Throws InsufficientFundsException if the amount is greater than the account balance. Throws InvalidAmountException if the amount is less than or equal to zero.

transfer(BankAccount toAccount, double amount): Transfers the specified amount to another account. Throws InsufficientFundsException if the amount is greater than the account balance. Throws AccountNotFoundException if the target account is not found(i,e if toAccount is null). Throws InvalidAmountException if the amount is less than or equal to zero.

applyForLoan(double amount): Allows the user to apply for a loan. Throws LoanNotAllowedException if the loan amount exceeds the allowed limit. Throws InvalidAmountException if the amount is less than or equal to zero.

      Select an option :
           1. Deposit
           2. Withdraw
           3. Transfer
