Program: 1
-----------
Create an abstract class Student with the following attributes.
Instance Variables:
studentName: protected String
studentClass: protected String
totalNoOfStudents : protected static int
Instance Methods:
abstract public : getPercentage( ) with return type int
static Method :
public static int getTotalNoStudents( )
