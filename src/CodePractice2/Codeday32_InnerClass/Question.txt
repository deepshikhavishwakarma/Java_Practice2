Question-1 [Programming]
--------------

You are developing a school management system in Java.
As part of this system, you have a School class that manages
students and teachers. Each student and teacher has a
name, ID, and age. To efficiently manage students and teachers,
you decide to use two static inner classes within the School
class: Student and Teacher. Your task is to implement the Student
and Teacher classes along with logical methods to determine
eligibility for graduation and retirement, respectively.



Write Java code fulfilling the following requirements:



Implement the Student class within the School class as a static
inner class. The Student class should have the following attributes:



Name (String)

ID (int)

Age (int)

Implement the Teacher class within the School class as a static
 inner class. The Teacher class should have the following
 attributes:



Name (String)

ID (int)

Age (int)

Provide methods within the Student class to:



Get the name, ID, and age of the student.

Check if the student is eligible for graduation. Assume the
minimum graduation age is 18.

Provide methods within the Teacher class to:



Get the name, ID, and age of the teacher.

Check if the teacher is eligible for retirement. Assume the
retirement age is 60.
